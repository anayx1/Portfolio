      `Tech enthusiast looking for a good Internship which would help me to add lines to my resume. Ready to learn new things which will grow my current skillset further.`,
      `I've been developing full-stack application since 2020. I didn't know what full-stack meant at that time because the term was not coined back then.`,
      `After learning HTML and struggling with CSS, I came up with a brilliant idea of using bootstrap so that I don't have to style everything by myself.`,
      `But now, I'm a legend. I've been coding in React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Java, Python`,
